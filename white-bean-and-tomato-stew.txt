White Bean and Tomato Stew

One of my favorite dishes from the Tohono O'Odham nation.

* 4 slices of bacon, chopped
* 6 chicken thighs with skin and bones (or boneless)
* 1 Tbs olive oil
* 2 cups chopped onion
* 5 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 cups stewed tomatoes
* 5 cups chicken broth
* 2 - 4 cups cooked white tepary beans

Cook bacon in a heavy pot until crispy.
Remove bacon and drain on paper.
Drain bacon fat from pot.
Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.
Add oil to pot and heat to shimmering.
Add chicken and cook until browned on all sides.
Remove chicken and set aside.
Add chopped onion and garlic to pan.
Cook until softened.
Add cooked bacon, chicken, tomatoes, and broth.
Cover and simmer until chicken is fully cooked, about 30 minutes.
Add cooked tepary beans and simmer until beans are warmed through, about 10 minutes.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Enjoy!
